  <h1>Productionising R at Nottinghamshire Healthcare</h1>

  <p>I‚Äôm hopeful we‚Äôre moving into a bit of a new phase with using R in my Trust so I thought I‚Äôd outline the direction of travel, to see if it chimes with anyone else and just to keep people up to date about what we‚Äôre doing.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve used Shiny for some years now, maybe 7, and we have applications behind the firewall and in the cloud which are well used by the staff who need them. We‚Äôve also been building our skills (R and data ops, which is a whole other post) and I‚Äôm hopeful that we‚Äôre ready for the next phase, which I would call the ‚Äúproductionise‚Äù phase. There are two main tasks to achieve before we‚Äôve really got the work that we‚Äôre doing nicely embedded in everyday practice at Nottinghamshire Healthcare.</p>
<p>The first thing we‚Äôre looking at at the moment is using the data warehouse better. We have a very large and well featured data warehouse and it does loads of really great stuff but we (and I‚Äôm the worst offender for this) are still relying too much on pulling stuff out of it to say, Excel, and then reading that into R and off we go with an analysis. It‚Äôs a lot of work getting it out and then you can‚Äôt really communicate with the data warehouse people easily about what you did because you‚Äôve introduced this whole other layer on top messing around with Excel sheets and you can‚Äôt easily tell them what you did. So the first bit for me (and this is not revolutionary in any way, we‚Äôre just building up to something) is to use the {odbc} and {pool} package, with shiny, to directly interface with the data warehouse, do the analysis, deploy it as a Shiny application, and just have it living live on the data warehouse. It‚Äôs striking straight away that when you do that suddenly you‚Äôre talking the same language as your BI team and you can communicate to them what you‚Äôve done and give them to tools to reimplement it themselves if they want to.</p>
<p>And the second bit we need to get right is productionising the Shiny applications themselves. I‚Äôve been looking at the {golem} package to do this. Golem really appeals to me for two reasons. Firstly, because it provides a robust framework for modularising code. I‚Äôm starting to realise that I do write the same Shiny code over and over again. Something in particular that I have done a lot is write code that makes sense of a spreadsheet. Ultimately I would like to write a module that can take an incredibly messy spreadsheet and with a few clicks from the user tidies it up ready for further processing. And with the right level of modularity I could use that over and over again. I did start writing one a little while ago but I got distracted.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve got a few projects coming up that exemplify the process and an abstract submitted at the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/r-medicine/">R in medicine conference</a> so hopefully I‚Äôll be back to say more about this all in due course with some real examples. In the meantime there‚Äôs some bare bones golem code <a href="https://github.com/ChrisBeeley/shinySPC">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/healthcareSPC">here</a> but it‚Äôs early days so please don‚Äôt judge me üôÇ</p>
