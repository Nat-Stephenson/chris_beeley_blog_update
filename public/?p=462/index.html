  <time datetime="2013-08-02T17:51:44&#43;00:00">August 2, 2013</time>

  <p>I’ve had my own server for a little while now, with a very scabby and unattractive webpage on it, some Java I haven’t got round to turning into an applet, a couple of random Shiny apps, and that’s about it.</p>
<p>I’m very busy at the moment writing a book so I’m afraid I haven’t really had time to work on any of these side projects. I have, however, done loads of cool things with the actual server, so I thought I might mention these. Having your own server is like all the best things in life, once you’ve got it you don’t know how you ever got on without it. So, what are all the exciting things that my server does?</p>
<ol>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It’s of course a place to put up random things that I do. I have already given people access to <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/" title="Shiny">Shiny</a> applications straight from my server and this has been very useful. I occasionally create other types of web reports in plain HTML that need sharing too, so that’s where they’ve gone<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>I host my own WordPress server. I used to be over at wordpress.com but now this blog lives right on the root of chrisbeeley.net. This is not useful in any way that I’m aware of but it’s pretty cool nonetheless</li>
<li>I have just this minute set up my own blog aggregator. Google famously just killed Google Reader, and I used The Old Reader for a bit, but they’re going private because they can’t cope with the traffic (quite reasonably, I should add, I take my hat off to them for trying to serve so many users in the first place). So now I have MY VERY OWN RSS server, that I can access through any web browser. And nobody can close it because it’s mine. The name of the program is <a href="http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki" title="Tiny Tiny RSS">Tiny Tiny</a> RSS and I salute the creator for open-sourcing</li>
<li>As well as Shiny Server for hosting Shiny applications I have even now set up RStudio server which means I can use R through the RStudio IDE on any web browser in the world. This is very useful for corporate environments, that kind of thing, I don’t think it serves any purpose for me to do it, unless I get into any arguments in net cafes about statistical distributions, but it’s cool and it was pretty easy once I realised my firewall was configured wrongly.</li>
</ol>
<p>So that’s me at the moment, doing a lot of work, and writing a book, learning a lot of stuff but not having any time to share any of it (got a 2 year old at home, too).</p>
<p>Watch out in September/ October time, I’ll have all sorts of weird and wonderful things to put up by then.</p>
<p>If anybody who knows me reads this and would like an RSS account on the server, just let me know. The loss of Google Reader was very painful to all of us and I’ve got loads of bandwidth going begging.</p>
