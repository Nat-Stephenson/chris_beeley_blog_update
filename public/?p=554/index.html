  <h1>Clearly Better For Analytics and Graphics (My LondonR talk- Developing with Shiny for the Web)</h1>

  
  
  <time datetime="2013-12-04T21:00:34&#43;00:00">December 4, 2013</time>

  <p>I gave a talk at the <a href="http://www.londonr.org/">LondonR</a> group last night about using <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/">Shiny</a> and particularly about integrating it with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery to go nicely with other web content. Appropriately enough, therefore, I made the whole talk using HTML. Thanks to Romain Francois for his excellent <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/highlight/index.html">highlight</a> package (surely it should be called highlightR, though?) with which I did the HTML for the highlighting of R syntax and to <a href="http://tohtml.com/">this</a> website with which I highlighted the HTML, JavaScript and jQuery.</p>
<p>I did promise to bring some free copies of my <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/web-application-development-with-r-using-shiny/book">book</a>, sadly these did not arrive from the publisher in time but I will get them sent out this week, apologies to the three people who won them.</p>
<p>Those who attended my talk will also know that there are three more e-copies up for grabs, so just answer the question I posed at the talk and send it to chrisDOTbeeleyATnottshcDOTnhsDOTuk and the first three will get a code to redeem for an electronic version, which includes pdf, Kindle, and online cloud access.</p>
<p>The talk is <a href="http://chrisbeeley.net/website/shinytalk/TalkPage.html">here</a>, have a look at the applications and code, hopefully you will find it useful. I should emphasise that I am expert in neither JavaScript nor HTML/ CSS and have written code that merely works so please don’t assume that all the HTML/ CSS is industry-standard, it really isn’t.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, older version of IE do something truly awful to the slides, I’m afraid I have neither the time nor the skill to do anything about this. I have tested it on IE10 as well as up to date versions of Chrome and Firefox so please use one of them instead.</p>
