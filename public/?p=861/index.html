  <h1>Working as a coder at a technology company versus working as a coder in other contexts</h1>

  
  
  <time datetime="2016-10-05T13:13:56&#43;00:00">October 5, 2016</time>

  <p>I was just skimming a <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/advice.html">book about Python</a> and I found a rather interesting quote:</p>
<p>“Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food joint. You’re much better off using code as your secret weapon in another profession.</p>
<p>People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and get no respect. People who can code in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do amazing things to advance those disciplines.”</p>
<p>Looking at salaries for developers as well as reading the experiences of coders in technology companies this really seems to ring true. I’m the other kind, I’ve picked up a bit of code in order to do my day job which is really focused on collecting and analysing user experience data. And actually I do get respect and I have been able to do a lot of new things that nobody was doing before I got started.</p>
<p>Quite inspiring words, really. I feel a renewed urge to develop my programming skills within the current role that I have to try to push things even further and will stop daydreaming about what it would be like to be a “real” programmer.</p>
