title: We need more than &#8220;black box&#8221; systems (Goldacre)

> The system should be cautious around imagining that it can push away the challenge of TREs – and all work with NHS data – by procuring ‘black box’ services. Building platforms, capacity and modern working methods for data is a complex technical challenge, requiring deep knowledge across a range of domains: data science, data architecture, and software development; but also clinical informatics, NHS data needs, health data research, and more. This work must be done close up with real users of data, constantly iterating to improve platforms and approaches. There is no single contract that can pass over responsibility for this work. These new and complex technical challenges around data must be met by building teams, tools, methods, working practices, code and platforms
